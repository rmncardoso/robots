"""Refuse work derived on a checkout the pull request's branch has moved past.

Why this exists
---------------
A pull request has *three* answers to "what is the head commit", not the two
``check_pr_head_is_current.py`` compares. That check reads the two the API
serves -- ``pullRequest { headRefOid }``, the value the pull request records,
against the tip of the branch in the head repository, the value that exists.
This one reads the third, which is the only one that decides what a fix gets
derived from: **the commit the local clone is actually on**.

The three disagree independently, and the third is the one with no signal:

===================================  ======================================
answer                               what moves it out of date
===================================  ======================================
``refs/pull/N/head``                 a mirror ref GitHub refreshes on its
                                     own schedule, so it trails a push to
                                     the fork branch
``pullRequest { headRefOid }``       normally reconciled within a second of
                                     a push; #2508 sat five hours behind
tip of the head repository's branch  nothing -- this is the value that
                                     exists, and what the other two are
                                     *for*
===================================  ======================================

Measured on #2678. A run checked the pull request out the obvious way and got
the mirror, while the API already served the commit that existed::

    git fetch origin pull/2678/head    ->  33f8bcf4     one commit behind
    pullRequest { headRefOid }         ->  0b070a05     the tip
    git merge-base --is-ancestor 33f8bcf4 0b070a05  ->  true, a pure lag

The cost is not a wasted fetch. The run believed it had checked out the branch,
grepped the symbol its review thread named, found it genuinely unused *on that
tree*, and derived a correct fix for source that no longer existed. What
surfaced the drift was ``git push`` being refused as non-fast-forward -- after
the work. A fix that happened to touch a different file would have pushed
cleanly.

And the answer it derived was worse than a duplicate. The thread was a CodeQL
"unused global ``_RATE_TAG``". Against the stale tree the fix is deletion, and
the suite agrees -- 18 passed, ruff clean. Against the tip the same finding
means the opposite: the constant was unused because the behavioural tests spelled
its value out at each call site, so nothing tied the joint under measurement to
the tag the parametrized sweep graded. Deletion would have passed CI while
removing the invariant the symbol existed to carry. An unused symbol in a test
file is often a *missing call site* rather than dead code, and the two fixes are
indistinguishable by test outcome.

#2520 records four instances of this class -- #2511 (one thread, four author
replies), #2566 (two runs deriving one fix), #2577 (two byte-identical commits,
one discarded), and #2678 above. In three of the four the only thing that
prevented a duplicate landing was a non-fast-forward push rejection, which is
load-bearing purely by accident: it fires because the mandated push shape is a
plain ``git push``, and both nearby shapes defeat it -- ``pull --rebase`` lands
an empty-diff commit on top, and ``--amend --force-with-lease`` deletes the
commit that already answered the thread.

Being ahead is not the finding
------------------------------
The comparison cannot be equality. A run that has committed its own work sits at
a commit the branch tip does not have yet, which is the ordinary state between a
commit and its push, and a check that reports it would cry wolf exactly when it
is being used correctly. So the question is ancestry, not identity: if the tip is
an ancestor of the checkout, the checkout contains everything the branch has and
the difference is the run's own unpushed work.

A tip that is *absent from the local object database* is not an ancestor and is
not unknowable either -- a local repository that has never fetched the tip
cannot contain it, so it is reported as stale rather than as indeterminate.

Outcomes
--------
``current``
    The checkout is the branch tip. The ordinary state at the start of a cycle,
    and the only one from which a thread's concern can be assessed.

``ahead``
    The tip is an ancestor of the checkout: the run's own commits, not yet
    pushed. Not a finding.

``stale-checkout``
    The finding. The branch has commits the checkout does not, so anything
    derived here answers a question about a tree somebody has already moved.

``unresolvable-head``
    The head repository or its branch could not be read -- a deleted fork, a
    deleted branch. Reported as its own outcome rather than folded into a pass,
    so a permissions or API-shape change cannot quietly turn this into a check
    that always agrees.

``unknown-checkout``
    The local ``HEAD`` could not be read; not a directory this can judge.

Why it reads the branch and not the mirror
------------------------------------------
Same reason ``check_pr_head_is_current.py`` reads the head repository's ref: the
value under suspicion cannot be its own witness. Here both of the cheap answers
are suspect -- the mirror is what produced the #2678 lag, and ``headRefOid`` is
what produced the #2508 one -- so the tip is resolved from the head repository's
own ref, through ``pullRequest { headRepository { nameWithOwner } headRefName }``.

Usage
-----
::

    python3 .github/scripts/check_checkout_is_pr_head.py --repo strands-labs/robots --pr 2678
    python3 .github/scripts/check_checkout_is_pr_head.py --repo strands-labs/robots --pr 2678 \\
        --checkout 33f8bcf4749a9146111294b4274be81326b50672

``--checkout`` defaults to ``git rev-parse HEAD`` in ``--git-dir`` (default: the
working directory). Exit 1 when the checkout is stale, so it can sit in front of
the work in a shell ``&&`` chain.

Unlike its sibling this takes no ``--all-open``: a checkout is a property of one
clone, so there is no population to sweep.
