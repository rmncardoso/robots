"""MuJoCo GL backend selection, kept free of every non-stdlib import.

MuJoCo reads ``MUJOCO_GL`` once, on first ``import mujoco``, so the value has to
be chosen before any import chain reaches that module. The package root runs
:func:`_configure_gl_backend` at import time for that reason, and *this* module
is where the selection lives rather than :mod:`strands_robots.simulation.mujoco.backend`
because importing anything under ``strands_robots.simulation`` executes that
package's ``__init__``, which imports :class:`~strands_robots.simulation.base.SimEngine`,
which imports the policy runner, which imports the rendering package - and
those import numpy. ``import strands_robots`` is documented as leaving numpy,
torch and mujoco out of ``sys.modules``, and a numpy initialised on the bare
import is what breaks a narrowed ``--cov=strands_robots.<subpackage>`` run:
coverage resolves the dotted source inside ``sys_modules_saved()``, so numpy is
initialised and then dropped from ``sys.modules``, and the next ``import numpy``
re-executes its Python layer over an already-initialised C extension (#3587).

Everything here is stdlib only: :mod:`ctypes`, :mod:`os`, :mod:`platform`,
:mod:`sys`, :mod:`pathlib` and :mod:`logging`. Keep it that way - a third-party
import added here lands on every ``import strands_robots``. The backend module
re-imports the names it still calls (``_is_headless`` for the viewer decision,
the NVIDIA ICD helpers for the software-rendering remedy), and
:mod:`strands_robots.doctor` reads the vocabulary helpers from here, so a
monkeypatch aimed at one of these helpers has to be set on this module.
