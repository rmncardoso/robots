def _stop_task_refusal(envelope: object) -> str | None:
    """Read whether a ``stop_task`` envelope reports a stop that did not happen.

    Two of the robot surfaces :class:`RobotDeviceDriver` can wrap answer a stop
    with an affirmative "I did not stop", and they spell it differently.
    ``G1Driver.stop_task`` reports ``status="error"`` and carries ``stopped``
    in a ``json`` block when its control loop outlasts the join budget, while
    ``ReachyDriver.stop_task`` reports a daemon that refused the stop through
    ``_refuse``, whose envelope carries a ``text`` block and no ``stopped`` key
    at all. So both signals are read: an explicit ``stopped`` flag is
    authoritative where the driver supplies one, and ``status`` answers for the
    envelopes that do not.

    ``teleop_mixin._stop_reported_stopped`` asks the same question of a
    ``stop_teleoperate`` envelope and is deliberately not reused: it returns
    ``True`` for an envelope with no ``json`` block, which is right there
    (nothing was teleoperating) and wrong here, because that is the shape a
    refused ``stop_task`` arrives in.

    Deliberately conservative, for the reason
    ``mesh.core._peers_that_did_not_stop`` gives: only an envelope that
    AFFIRMATIVELY reports a failure is flagged. Anything else -- a driver that
    returns nothing, a test double, a shape this function does not recognise --
    is left alone, because a false "did not stop" on the safety path trains
    operators to ignore the warning.

    Args:
        envelope: Whatever the wrapped robot's ``stop_task`` returned.

    Returns:
        The reason the robot gave for not stopping, or ``None`` when the stop is

    cannot spell ``None`` for a declared ``int``, so the integer ``0`` is this
    surface's documented "use the provider default" sentinel and is the only
    value that means it.

    Every other value is handed on unchanged, so
    :meth:`~strands_robots.hardware_robot.Robot._policy_port_error` - the guard
    that holds ``policy_port`` to the shared
    :func:`~strands_robots.utils.tcp_port_error` domain and names the value the
    caller supplied - is the one surface that judges it. Reading the parameter
    with ``or`` instead conflated the two: ``0.0``, ``False``, ``""`` and ``[]``
    are falsy without being the sentinel, and once ``or`` had turned them into
    ``None`` that guard could no longer tell a malformed port from a port that
    was never sent. It answered "policy_port is required to build a policy" -
    the report of "a port they had passed was missing" that guard's own
    docstring says it was written to remove - while the truthy malformed
    spellings (``5556.7``, ``"5556"``, ``-1``) were refused by name. Same
    mistake, two answers, decided by truthiness.
