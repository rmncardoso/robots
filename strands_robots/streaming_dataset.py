"""Streaming read-back for LeRobotDataset - read frames directly from the Hub.

Primary use: in-process eval / replay / notebooks / agent loops (NOT a
precondition for streamed *training* - ``python -m lerobot.scripts.lerobot_train
--dataset.streaming=true`` already uses StreamingLeRobotDataset via
``lerobot.datasets.factory.make_dataset``).

Design mirrors :mod:`strands_robots.dataset_recorder`:
  * lerobot is NEVER imported at module top-level (numpy/pandas ABI safety on
    Jetson; see the :mod:`strands_robots.dataset_recorder` header).
  * Constructor kwargs are forwarded via ``inspect.signature`` introspection so
    a lerobot version bump can't break us (lerobot's dataset API drifted across
    0.5.0->0.5.2; streaming is newer and still changing - upstream has a
    multi-thread prefetch TODO).

            recording writes through
            (:func:`~strands_robots.dataset_recorder.local_dataset_dir`), so a
            ``repo_id`` that is itself a path streams the directory it recorded
            to with no ``root`` restated. Only that rule is resolved here: an
            ``owner/name`` id keeps its absent root, which is how
            ``StreamingLeRobotDataset`` selects LeRobot's revision-safe Hub
            metadata cache - already the directory a local recording under that
            id wrote to.

        Validation:
            The numeric knobs are checked against
            :data:`_NUMERIC_DOMAINS`, and the flags in :data:`_BOOLEAN_FLAGS`
            against the shared boolean domain, before the lerobot import -
            because ``StreamingLeRobotDataset`` validates only ``repo_type`` and
            stores the rest verbatim. So an unusable one is a caller mistake
            reported the same way with or without the extra installed, rather
            than a NumPy error part-way through iteration, a shard count of zero
            that streams no frames, or a tolerance that switches the grid check
            off.

            The flags are checked rather than parsed for the reason
            :func:`~strands_robots.utils.boolean_flag_error` gives: each selects
            a posture, and read by truthiness every one of them lands on the
            branch the caller was opting *out* of. ``drop_videos="false"``
            stripped the camera keys it spells the keeping of;
            ``validate_deltas=0`` switched off the grid check below;
            ``shuffle="false"`` reached the advancing generator; ``streaming=0``
            failed inside lerobot on ``num_shards``; and ``return_uint8=None``
            streamed float32 with the warning about that cost suppressed by the
            same truthiness. :data:`_BOOLEAN_FLAGS` records each one.

        Ordering:
            ``shuffle`` does not decide read order, and passing
            ``shuffle=False`` alone reads shuffled frames. It selects only
            which generator drives the reordering -
            ``np.random.default_rng(seed)``, reseeded identically on every
            exhaustion, versus the dataset's own advancing one - so it decides
            reproducibility ACROSS epochs, matching lerobot's own "whether to
            shuffle the dataset across exhaustions". ``StreamingLeRobotDataset``
            reorders either way, at two levels: it samples a shard at random per
            frame, and it yields from a reservoir buffer of ``buffer_size``.
            Capture order therefore needs ``buffer_size=1`` (a reservoir of one
            has nothing to reorder) together with ``max_num_shards=1`` (a single
            shard has nothing to interleave). Nothing reports a shuffled read,
            so an eval or replay loop that asked for order with ``shuffle``
            alone silently consumes frames out of order.

        Raises:
            ValueError: A numeric knob (``tolerance_s``, ``buffer_size``,
                ``max_num_shards`` or ``seed``) is outside its domain, or a flag
                in :data:`_BOOLEAN_FLAGS` was not supplied as a boolean. The
                message names the parameter, the value and why it cannot be

                accepts it; earlier releases do not. The ``[lerobot]`` extra
                floors lerobot at that version, so this guard only fires for an

    """Open a streaming reader for a LeRobotDataset without a simulator.

    Thin module-level alias for :meth:`StreamingDatasetReader.open`, exported
    at the package root (``strands_robots.stream_dataset``). Use this from
    training/eval scripts that only need to READ a dataset - it never touches
    MuJoCo, a GL context, or a thread pool, unlike constructing a ``Robot()``
    simulation. ``Simulation.stream_dataset`` is sugar delegating here so the
    "the same Robot() that records reads it back" flow still works.

    Args:
        repo_id: HF dataset id (e.g. ``"lerobot/svla_so100_pickplace"``) or a
            ``repo_id`` that is itself a path, which streams the directory it
            recorded to with no ``root`` restated.
        **kwargs: Forwarded to :meth:`StreamingDatasetReader.open` - e.g.
            ``root``, ``delta_timestamps``, ``episodes``, ``shuffle``,
            ``buffer_size``, ``max_num_shards``, ``drop_videos``
            (proprio-only, torchcodec-free), ``repo_type``.

    Returns:
        A :class:`StreamingDatasetReader`.

    Example:
        import strands_robots

            "lerobot/svla_so100_pickplace",
