"""Offline wandb-run-id -> local-checkpoint resolver for the VERA container.

Why this exists
---------------
VERA loads its Jacobian IDM by **wandb run id**: ``load_checkpoint`` builds a
``run_path = "{entity}/{project}/{run_id}"`` and calls
``vera.utils.ckpt_utils.download_checkpoint``, which does
``wandb.Api().run(run_path)`` **unconditionally** - before it checks whether the
checkpoint already exists on disk. In an offline container (no wandb network /
no API key) that call raises, so the server never comes up.

But the released checkpoints DO carry their wandb run path in ``provenance.json``
(e.g. ``idm-mimicgen-37oa162u/provenance.json`` ->
``your-wandb-entity/jacobian-learning/37oa162u``). So we can resolve the run id
to the locally-mounted ckpt dir WITHOUT wandb.

What this does
--------------
Monkeypatches ``vera.utils.ckpt_utils.download_checkpoint`` (and the symbol
already imported into ``vera.policy.motion_policy_loading``) with a version that:

1. Scans ``$VERA_CKPT_ROOT`` for ``*/provenance.json`` whose ``wandb_run`` matches
   the requested ``run_path`` (full ``entity/project/run_id`` OR just the trailing
   ``run_id`` - tolerant of the entity/project drift between code defaults and the
   released artifacts). A file that cannot be read as such a record - it does not
   parse, does not hold a JSON object, or carries a non-string ``wandb_run`` - is
   skipped, so one malformed record among the mounted checkpoints never decides
   whether the healthy ones resolve.
2. If found, returns that dir's ``model.ckpt`` (+ the ``config.yaml`` sidecar as
   the run config when ``return_config=True``), exactly like the real function.
3. If NOT found, falls back to the original wandb-backed implementation (so online
   use / other run ids still work).

Activate by importing this module before building the policy. The entrypoint sets
``PYTHONSTARTUP``-style activation via ``-c "import wandb_offline_resolve"`` … but
simplest is: the entrypoint runs ``python -c "import wandb_offline_resolve; import runpy; runpy.run_module('vera.server.start_vera_server', run_name='__main__')"``.
See entrypoint.sh.

No edits to the VERA source tree are required.

def _index_local_ckpts(ckpt_root: str) -> dict[str, Path]:
    """Map every usable wandb_run string (full + trailing run_id) -> ckpt dir.

    A ``provenance.json`` this cannot read as a run record is skipped, exactly
    like one that omits ``wandb_run`` entirely: it does not parse, it does not
    hold a JSON object, or its ``wandb_run`` is not a string. The index is built
    while the container is still starting, and the resolver's only fallback is
    the network this container exists to do without, so one malformed record
    among the mounted checkpoints must not decide whether the healthy ones
    resolve. :func:`strands_robots.transforms.provenance.load_provenance` reads
    a provenance payload by the same rule - check the type before using the
    value - and refuses instead, because a caller asking which episodes are
    synthetic has no fallback to be handed.

    Args:
        ckpt_root: Directory scanned recursively for ``*/provenance.json``.

    Returns:
        Every usable run string mapped to the checkpoint directory that holds
        it, keyed both by the full ``entity/project/run_id`` and by the trailing
        ``run_id`` alone.
