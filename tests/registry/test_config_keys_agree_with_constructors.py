"""Every registry key that can reach a provider constructor must name a parameter of it.

``policies.json`` describes each provider with a ``config_keys`` list and an
optional ``defaults`` map, and ``build_policy_kwargs`` merges both into one dict
that ``create_policy`` splats into the provider class.  Nothing in the tree
compared either against a constructor signature: ``grep -rn config_keys tests/``
finds presence checks (``"port" in config["config_keys"]``) and filtering
behaviour, never an agreement check.  #2013 pinned the property for one provider
alone, deliberately, and named the general form #2022 - this is it.

The two sources are not equally guarded, which is why both are checked here.

``config_keys`` is a filter, so a stale entry only bites when a caller happens
to pass that key::

    for key, value in extra.items():
        if key in allowed_keys:          # a stale entry is reachable, not forced
            kwargs[key] = value

``defaults`` has no such test::

    for key, default_val in defaults.items():
        if key not in kwargs:            # no ``key in allowed_keys`` here
            kwargs[key] = default_val

So a ``defaults`` key is inserted on *every* call, with no caller involvement.
An orphaned one is therefore strictly worse than an orphaned ``config_keys``
entry: it makes ``create_policy(provider)`` raise for every caller, not only for
one that passes the key.  ``test_a_defaults_key_bypasses_the_config_keys_filter``
pins that asymmetry, so the reason these tests cover ``defaults`` cannot quietly
stop being true.

What an orphan costs splits by provider shape.  ``cosmos3`` declares no
``**kwargs``, so an orphan is a hard ``TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected
keyword argument`` on the factory path - the path the registry exists to serve -
while a caller constructing the class directly is unaffected.  Most of the rest
swallow it into a ``**kwargs`` nothing reads, which is the inert-public-knob
shape #2013 was filed about rather than a safer outcome.  The guard is the
strict form for that reason: it is what every provider already satisfies, and
the lenient form (an entry is fine if the class takes ``**kwargs``) would exempt
most of them and assert almost nothing.

**This is a drift guard, not a live defect.** Every provider is consistent
today, in both directions, so there is no pre-fix failure to show - only the
guard plus the planted-orphan meta-tests that keep it from passing vacuously.

Kept as a test rather than a runtime check in ``build_policy_kwargs``:
``policies.json`` ships in-tree and changes only when someone edits it, so
disagreement is a development-time property, and paying an ``inspect.signature``
per ``create_policy`` call would import every provider's optional dependencies
to answer a question the suite can settle once.
