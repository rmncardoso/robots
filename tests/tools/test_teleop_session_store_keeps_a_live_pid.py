"""The teleop session store must not delete the record of a live process.

``SessionManager._load_sessions`` prunes finished sessions and *writes the
pruned map back to disk*, and that store is the only place a detached
teleoperation subprocess's PID is recorded. So the prune's classification is
load-bearing: a record dropped by mistake is gone for good, and the process it
named keeps driving the arm with no supported way to stop it.

Two probes decide the classification. ``psutil.pid_exists`` answers whether the
number exists; reading the process's start time answers whether it is still the
one the record was written for, which is what a reused PID changes. When the
second one raises they disagree, and the two ways it can raise mean opposite
things:

* ``NoSuchProcess`` - reaped between the two calls, so the record names nothing.
* ``AccessDenied`` - the process exists and this user may not inspect it (a
  session started under ``sudo`` for serial-port access, listed as the invoking
  user). Existence was already established, so this is not death.

These tests pin that only the first prunes, that no read path erases a record it
could not inspect, and that ``stop`` can still reach such a session. The prune
of a genuinely finished session is pinned unchanged alongside, so the retention
cannot grow into "never prune anything".

The training tool keeps a session store of the same shape and is held to the
same rule -- no record dropped on the strength of a probe that could not be
taken -- in ``tests.tools.test_train_session_store_keeps_a_live_pid``. Its
retention policy differs: it keeps a finished run for its log tail where this
one prunes it.
