"""A ``Goal_Velocity`` magnitude that would set the direction bit is refused.

The STS/SMS series encodes ``Goal_Velocity`` (register 0x2E) as sign-magnitude,
not as a plain unsigned 16-bit value: bit 15 carries the direction and bits 0-14
the magnitude. :mod:`~strands_robots.tools.serial_tool` bounded the field to the
two-byte maximum instead, so every magnitude from 32768 up was accepted and put
its own two bytes on the wire - where the servo read them as a command in the
opposite direction:

===============  ==================  ==========================================
``velocity=``    bytes on the wire   what the servo executes
===============  ==================  ==========================================
32767            ``2E FF 7F``        +32767, forward (the largest true magnitude)
32768            ``2E 00 80``        magnitude 0 - it *stops*
40000            ``2E 40 9C``        -7232, reverse
65535            ``2E FF FF``        -32767, full speed reverse
===============  ==================  ==========================================

Each returned ``status="success"`` quoting the number supplied, so the report
described a command the servo never received - and for 65535 the arm ran at full
speed the wrong way. That is the same silent-reinterpretation the sibling fields
are bounded to prevent, which is why the module's own docstring says bounding the
field is what makes the success message true.

``Goal_Position`` (0x2A) is sign-magnitude on bit 15 too, and needed no change:
its 12-bit ceiling of 4095 sits far below the direction bit, so a position the
tool accepts can never reach it. Its bound was already keyed to the register
rather than to the byte width, which is exactly what ``velocity``'s was not.

The vendor semantics is not this suite's invention. lerobot's Feetech tables
declare ``"Goal_Velocity": 15`` in ``STS_SMS_SERIES_ENCODINGS_TABLE`` and encode
through ``encode_sign_magnitude``, which raises for a magnitude above 32767;
:class:`TestTheVendorAgreesWhereTheMagnitudeEnds` pins that agreement whenever
lerobot is installed.
