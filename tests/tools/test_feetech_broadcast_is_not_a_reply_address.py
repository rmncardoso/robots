"""``serial_tool`` must not address the whole bus when it is about to read one reply.

The Feetech Protocol 1 ID byte carries every unicast address and one address that
is no servo: ``0xfe`` is the broadcast. ``motor_id`` was bounded at ``254`` for a
reason about the field's width -- "the packet carries the ID in one byte, and 255
is the frame header" -- which is true of the byte and says nothing about which of
its values a servo can hold. So ``action="feetech_ping"`` accepted the broadcast:
it wrote ``FF FF FE 02 01 FE``, slept, read ten bytes and reported
``Feetech Motor 254 responded: <hex>``. Every servo on the bus receives that
frame and, because ``PING`` is answered, every one of them replies at once; on a
half-duplex bus those replies collide, so the bytes read back belong to no single
servo and the ID quoted beside them belongs to none either.

The address space is not this module's to invent.
:mod:`~strands_robots.drivers.feetech.protocol` declares ``BROADCAST_ID`` and
``MAX_UNICAST_ID`` ("Highest ID a specific servo may hold. 0xFE is the
broadcast") and refuses the same intent from ``build_packet`` unless the caller
passes ``allow_broadcast=True`` "for ``SYNC_WRITE`` and other reply-less
instructions that legitimately target the broadcast ID". The tool now applies
that same rule one layer up, before the port is opened, so the two cannot
disagree about which address is a servo and which is the whole bus.

A reply-less write is deliberately still allowed to address the broadcast:
``feetech_position`` and ``feetech_velocity`` never read a status packet, so
moving every servo with one frame means exactly what it says. That asymmetry is
the point, and it is pinned in both directions here.

Why nothing caught this: the numeric-domain suite's refusal sweep is
``(0, 255, 256, 300, -1, True, 2.5, "1")`` -- the broadcast is inside the ID byte
and so is absent from a sweep of values outside it -- while its acceptance sweep
listed ``254`` under the name
``test_an_addressable_motor_id_still_reaches_the_wire``. The broadcast is the one
value in range that is not addressable, and that name recorded the opposite.
