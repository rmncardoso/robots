"""A ``<geom>`` that states no ``type`` is a sphere, and both readers say so.

MJCF gives ``<geom>`` a default type, and it is ``sphere``: ``<geom size="0.03"/>``
compiles to a 0.03 m ball, with ``size`` holding the radius. Two functions in
:mod:`strands_robots.simulation.isaac.loaders` resolve that attribute -
``_extract_mjcf_shape`` for a robot link's ``BodyDef``, and ``_geom_aabb`` for a
scene object's bound - and they disagreed about the default: the AABB reader used
``sphere``, the link reader used ``box``.

Read as a box, such a geom loses its ``size`` as well as its shape, because the
box branch needs three components and a ball declares one: a link written
``<geom size="0.03"/>`` reported a 0.05 m box, so a 60 mm ball spawned as a
100 mm cube and nothing in the load reported a problem. The two readers also
answered the same element two different ways, which is the shape this file pins
shut - both resolve the default through one name now, so neither can drift.

MuJoCo is the oracle throughout: the expected primitive and size are read back
off a compiled ``MjModel`` rather than restated, and the default itself is
asserted against what the compiler does with a typeless geom.
