"""``MinkIKBridge.ee_pose`` refuses a non-finite configuration instead of reporting one.

:class:`~strands_robots.simulation.ik.MinkIKBridge` has exactly two methods that
*apply* a joint configuration to its own state - both call
``self._configuration.update(...)`` - and until now only one of them held that
array to a domain. ``solve`` gained
:func:`~strands_robots.utils.finite_vector_error` for its ``q_init``; ``ee_pose``,
the forward-kinematics reader with 19 call sites across five modules, read the
same kind of array into the same call one line down and checked nothing.

Measured against a Panda (``nq=9``) whose healthy ``ee_pose`` returns a pose with
sixteen finite entries: a single ``nan`` or ``inf`` anywhere in ``qpos`` returned
a ``(4, 4)`` pose with **12 of 16** entries non-finite, under a successful return
shaped exactly like a reachable pose. Three consumers then inherit it:

* a ``norm(ee[:3, 3] - target)`` residual - the shape six call sites in the two
  motion-primitive backends use - comes back ``nan``, and ``nan <= threshold``
  is ``False``, so a convergence test never fires;
* ``tracking_error`` reported ``{"mean_mm": nan, "max_mm": nan}``;
* the closed loop in ``policies/cosmos3/sim_ik.py``
  composes a delta onto this pose and solves for it, so ``solve``'s own guard
  refused one step later naming ``target_pose`` - an argument the caller never
  supplied. The caller supplied ``q0``.

That last one is why this is worth a guard rather than a docstring: the sibling
change that guarded ``solve`` turned a silent wrong answer into a *misattributed*
refusal, and only a guard at the method that reads the caller's own array can
name it.

The check costs 8.466 us against a 3759 us ``solve``, and every in-package
consumer pairs ``ee_pose`` with a solve or a norm, so it is 0.224% of a
closed-loop step. Against a *bare* ``ee_pose`` (21.66 us of pure forward
kinematics) it is 64.2%, which is the honest figure for ``tracking_error``'s
per-row loop; a 1000-step trajectory pays about 8 ms.

The shared domain is used verbatim rather than fronted by a fast
``np.all(np.isfinite(...))`` test, and :class:`TestTheSharedDomainIsNotReimplemented`
measures why: that test *accepts* a 0-d scalar and a 2-D array which the domain
refuses, so a hand-rolled fast path would decline to judge two spellings its own
siblings reject.

Two things are deliberately not claimed. The bridge does not carry the damage
across calls - ``solve`` re-seeds the configuration every time, so the next
healthy solve was already clean before this change; the guard's placement ahead
of the mutation is craft, and :class:`TestTheRefusalCostsTheBridgeNothing` pins
it. And ``tracking_error`` gains its refusal by *inheritance* rather than by a
guard of its own: the sibling change left it alone because a ``nan`` reading is
visibly non-finite, and this change reaches it through the method it calls.
:class:`TestTheConsumersInheritTheRefusal` records that consequence rather than
leaving it to be discovered.

The behavioural cells drive the real ``ee_pose`` against the fake ``mink`` module
the sibling suites already use, so nothing here needs ``mink``, ``mujoco`` or
``qpsolvers`` installed.
