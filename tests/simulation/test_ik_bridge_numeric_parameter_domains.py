"""Every numeric knob on the shared IK bridge is refused when it cannot be honored.

:class:`~strands_robots.simulation.ik.MinkIKBridge` is the one home for the mink
differential-IK solve, re-exported as the public ``MinkIKBridge`` of the
``cosmos3`` provider and documented as a constructor a caller
builds directly (``docs/policies/cosmos3.md``). It validated two of its
arguments thoroughly - ``commanded_dofs`` per element, with ``bool`` rejected by
name and every index range-checked, and ``solver`` through
:func:`~strands_robots.simulation.ik.resolve_qp_solver` - and handed its eight
numeric knobs straight through.

Every one of those knobs is *applied* rather than forwarded: ``max_iters``
bounds the ``range`` the solve loop iterates, ``dt`` integrates the joint
velocity, ``damping`` and the three task costs weight the QP, and the two
thresholds decide when the loop breaks. So an unusable value produced a
plausible-looking joint configuration rather than an error. Measured against a
Panda on a reachable 80 mm target whose converged residual is 0.761 mm:

* ``max_iters=0`` (also ``False``, also a negative count) made ``range`` empty,
  so ``solve`` ran the solver zero times and returned ``q_init`` unchanged with
  the full 80 mm still to go - a solve that never happened, reported as one.
* ``max_iters=True`` ran exactly one iteration: 14.147 mm.
* ``pos_threshold`` and ``ori_threshold`` both infinite (also both ``True``)
  made the *first* iteration count as converged - 14.147 mm, byte-identical to
  ``max_iters=1``.
* ``dt`` of ``0.0``, ``nan`` or ``inf``, ``damping`` of ``nan``, and any
  infinite task cost each returned an all-NaN configuration.
* ``damping=inf`` produced no joint motion at all - again the full 80 mm, and
  ``damping=True`` weighted the QP a thousandfold heavier than the ``1e-3``
  default for a residual of 29.673 mm.

The remaining spellings failed *late* instead: a fractional, non-finite, string
or ``None`` ``max_iters`` raised ``TypeError`` from ``range`` inside ``solve``,
and a negative ``damping`` raised ``qpsolvers``' "matrix P is not positive
definite" mid-solve - both after the QP backend was resolved, both tasks were
built and the bridge had logged that it was ready.

The behavioural classes drive the real constructor and the real solve loop
against the fake ``mink`` module the sibling suite already uses, so nothing here
needs ``mink``, ``mujoco`` or ``qpsolvers`` installed.
