"""Regression tests: every backend's camera pixel dimensions share one floor.

``width`` / ``height`` reach three surfaces on every simulation backend - the
constructor's ``default_width`` / ``default_height``, which every camera that
declares no size of its own is registered at; the ``add_camera`` that fixes one
camera's resolution; and the render family (``render`` / ``get_frame`` /
``get_camera_params``) that can override it per call - plus a fourth on Newton
alone, ``open_viewer``, which sizes the ``"gl"`` window. MuJoCo validated the
middle two through ``_validate_render_dims``; Newton and Isaac validated
neither, and coerced with a bare ``int(...)`` that refuses nothing useful.
Coercion is validation only when the coercion rejects. The constructor was
graded by no backend at all, which is the surface
``TestTheEngineDefaultResolution`` closes.

Measured on both backends before the fix:

* **An uncatchable exception through the tool-result contract.** ``width="big"``
  raised ``ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'big'`` out of
  ``add_camera``, ``None`` a ``TypeError``, ``nan`` a ``ValueError`` and ``inf``
  an ``OverflowError``. On Isaac the ``int()`` sat *outside* the method's try
  block, so none of them could even be converted into an error envelope.
* **A camera that cannot produce a frame, reported as success.**
  ``add_camera(width=0, height=-4)`` returned ``status="success"`` and stored the
  values, deferring the failure to the first render - far from the call that
  caused it. On Isaac a stored negative width made every later render of that
  camera fail (``ValueError: negative dimensions are not allowed`` out of the
  blank-frame ``np.zeros``), so one bad configuration call disabled the camera
  for the rest of the session.
* **Truthiness where membership was meant.** Isaac's
  ``int(width or self._config.camera_width)`` and Newton's
  ``int(width or self.default_width)`` read a falsy ``0`` as *omitted*, so the
  caller asked for an impossible resolution and was handed the default while
  being told it was what they requested - the harder failure to notice of the
  two, and the same shape as the ``position or <default>`` bug
  ``coerce_pose_vector``'s docstring documents.
* **Silent truncation, with the success text disagreeing with the registry.**
  ``width=2.7`` stored 2 and ``True`` stored 1, while Newton's success message
  echoed the caller's raw value (``"Camera 'cam' added (2.7x480, ...)"`` /
  ``"(Truex480, ...)"``) - reporting a resolution that was never registered.

* **One quantity, two contracts, decided by which method was called.** Newton's
  ``open_viewer`` sized its ``"gl"`` window from the same "how many pixels"
  value and applied no domain at all, so 12 of the 13 dimensions below were
  refused by ``render`` and forwarded verbatim into ``ViewerGL`` on the same
  engine, in the same session. The consequence is the one the neighbouring
  ``port`` guard already states in its own comment: the engine holds a single
  viewer slot, so ``open_viewer("gl", width=0, height=0)`` returned
  ``status="success"``, built a zero-pixel window and filled the slot - after
  which the obvious recovery, calling ``open_viewer`` again with a usable size,
  was answered ``"Viewer already open (gl)."`` under ``status="success"`` and
  built nothing. The caller was left with the window they did not ask for and
  no way to replace it.

The fix routes every one of those surfaces through
:func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_count_error`, the domain MuJoCo's floor
already implements: a true ``int`` (``bool`` refused - it is an ``int`` subclass
whose ``True`` would act as a silent 1) that is ``>= 1``. A pixel dimension is
consumed directly as an array / framebuffer dimension, where an integral float
raises ``TypeError`` rather than being coerced, which is why it belongs to that
domain rather than to the looser
:func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_whole_number_error` used for frame rates.
The *upper* bound stays backend-specific: MuJoCo caps at its offscreen
framebuffer, and the ray-traced backends have no such buffer, so
``TestSameVerdictAcrossBackends`` pins agreement on the floor only.

None of this needs ``newton`` / ``warp`` / Isaac Sim or a GPU: the validation
runs before either backend touches its solver or its stage, so the newton-free
stub and the ``__new__`` Isaac skeleton the sibling ``add_camera`` tests
already establish exercise it in every environment.

    registers for the free camera and into one entry per model camera on every

    the constructor writes into the very field ``add_camera`` guards, and every
    value ``add_camera`` refuses had a second, ungraded way in.

    Deferring to the render entry points was not a late refusal but three
    different wrong answers, measured on a so101 MuJoCo scene before the fix:

    * ``default_width=0`` published ``observation["default"]`` as a
      ``(480, 0, 3)`` zero-pixel frame under ``status="success"``.
    * ``-1`` and ``inf`` dropped the image key altogether - ``_render_cameras``
      logs a per-camera failure at debug level and keeps going - so a policy
      declaring ``requires_images`` was handed proprioception alone, with
      nothing in the result saying an image was missing.
    * ``True``, ``2.7``, ``640.0``, ``'640'`` and ``nan`` raised ``TypeError``
      out of ``get_observation``, which
      :class:`~strands_robots.simulation.base.SimEngine` documents as returning
      an observation dict.

    Every ``render()`` was meanwhile refused - a call that passes no dimensions
    at all, answered ``"render: width and height must be > 0, got 0x480"``,
    quoting a value its caller never named. On Isaac the legacy spelling went
    through ``int(...)`` into the graded ``camera_width`` field, so the coercion
    *defeated* that domain: ``True`` stored a 1-pixel camera, ``2.7`` stored 2,
    ``640.0`` and ``'640'`` stored 640, and ``inf`` / ``[640]`` / ``nan`` raised
    ``OverflowError`` / ``TypeError`` / ``ValueError`` from inside ``int()``,

        Runs the real MuJoCo engine, because the pre-fix failures were all
        downstream of construction.

        Gated on the shared GL probe: ``render`` and ``get_observation`` both
        need an offscreen context, and on a headless host without EGL/OSMesa
        they report an error that names neither GL nor this contract. Measured
        under MuJoCo's documented ``MUJOCO_GL=disable``: ``render`` reports
        ``{"status": "error"}`` carrying "Rendering unavailable (no OpenGL
        context)", and ``get_observation`` omits the image key altogether, so
        reading it raises ``KeyError: 'default'`` - naming this contract even
        less than the bare ``'error' != 'success'`` the probe exists to prevent.
