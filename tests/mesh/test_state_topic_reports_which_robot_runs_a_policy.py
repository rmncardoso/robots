"""The state topic's per-robot ``active`` flag is measured, not asserted.

``Mesh._read_state`` publishes a ``robots`` section naming every robot in the
sim world. The flag beside each name used to be the literal ``True``, so it was
constant for the life of the peer: a scene's idle arms and the one arm executing
a rollout were indistinguishable at 10 Hz, and the flag could not change when a
policy started or stopped.

The ``status`` command already answers that question from the running-policy
registry (``robots_running``), so the two surfaces disagreed about one fact.
These cases hold them to the same source: whatever set the flag marks active is
the set ``status`` reports running, in every phase of a real rollout, from a
parent ``Simulation`` peer and from a ``SimRobot`` child peer alike.

Also pinned, so the measurement cannot be traded for the old shortcut: a peer
that reports no in-flight population still gets its ``robots`` section, with no
flag beside the names rather than an invented one, and a population that cannot
be read is named in ``degraded`` rather than answered with a fabricated flag.
