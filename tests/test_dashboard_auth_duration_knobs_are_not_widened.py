"""The three auth duration knobs resolve through one domain, or are refused.

``TOKEN_TTL``, ``SESSION_MAX_AGE`` and ``HANDOFF_TTL`` are how an operator
NARROWS the window in which a dashboard session can command real hardware. Each
was read with a bare ``int(os.getenv(...))`` under ``except ValueError: return
<the default>``, so every spelling that is not a plain integer -- ``1h``,
``30s``, ``15m``, a trailing comment -- resolved to the shipped default, and the
default is the WIDER value in all three cases. The operator who shortened the
window kept the long one and was told nothing.

The module already states the rule this broke: :func:`auth._challenge_cap`
refuses a cap it cannot use precisely so that "an operator who narrowed a cap
and mistyped it must hear about it, not silently be handed the wide default
back". These pins hold the duration knobs to the same rule, and hold the three
things deliberately left alone: an EMPTY variable still means unset, a bare
integer is still honoured end to end, and a maximum age below the token
lifetime is still a legal pair.

    credential store. :func:`auth._store_path` resolves an unset ``STORE`` to
    ``~/.strands_dashboard/auth.json`` - the file that decides whether a
    dashboard on this machine is sealed - so without this redirect these cells
    both read and WRITE it: on a machine with no store they create one, and on
    a machine whose store is unparseable :func:`auth._preserve_corrupt` renames
    the operator's file aside and writes a fresh JWT secret, invalidating every
    live session token. Both under a green report. A store that parses but
    carries no ``jwt_secret`` makes two cells fail for a reason that has
    nothing to do with a duration, so the verdict is decided by what the
    machine already holds. ``$HOME`` is fresh in CI, so no gate reports any of
    it. The ten sibling ``test_dashboard_auth_*`` modules that reach the store
