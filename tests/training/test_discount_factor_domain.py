"""The discount factor is checked against its interval, not left to the return.

``RLTrainSpec.gamma`` weights every future reward in the return an RL algorithm
optimizes, and it is the one coefficient both RL backends read: PPO discounts
the GAE recursion with it (on the single-env and the vectorized rollout path),
FastSAC discounts its target-Q bootstrap. Neither preflight bounded it, and the
arithmetic that consumes it never judges it, so an unusable value was accepted:
``gamma > 1`` makes the discounted return diverge in the rollout horizon and the
run still reports success and writes a checkpoint, ``gamma < 0`` alternates the
sign of each future reward so the trace stops accumulating return, ``bool`` is a
silent ``gamma`` of one, and a non-finite value surfaces only once the update
samples the action distribution - as a torch constraint error naming neither the
field nor the run, after the env, the networks and a full rollout are built.

The off-policy preflights already bounded their own interval coefficient this way
(``tau`` must be in ``(0, 1]``); this pins the same shape for the field both
on-policy backends share. That precedent is a shared gate too now rather than a
bare comparison inside each backend - see
``tests/training/test_polyak_coefficient_domain.py``, whose interval is half-open
where this one is closed. Every test here reaches the real ``validate`` entry point, so it
covers the wiring as well as the domain.
