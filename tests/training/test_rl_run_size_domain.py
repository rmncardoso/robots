"""The two factors an RL run's length is derived from are checked against a domain.

``RLTrainSpec.total_timesteps`` and ``RLTrainSpec.rollout_steps`` are the two
caller-supplied factors of the one loop bound every RL backend derives::

    steps_per_iter = rollout_steps * num_envs
    num_iters = max(1, total_timesteps // steps_per_iter)
    for it in range(num_iters):  # collect, update

Because the bound is *derived* rather than read straight off the spec, a bare
``value <= 0`` test on either factor is weaker than the same test on a field
consumed directly: the ``max(1, ...)`` clamp turns every value that survives the
comparison but cannot divide into a silent single iteration. Measured on both
trainers over a 16-step run with ``rollout_steps=4`` before this gate existed,
``True``, ``0.5``, ``nan`` and ``inf`` each reported ``status="success"``, ran
**one** iteration, wrote a checkpoint and announced ``"1 iterations x 4 steps
complete"``; ``100.5`` raised ``TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted
as an integer`` out of ``range()`` after the environment, the networks, the
optimizers and (FastSAC) the replay buffer had been built; and ``"16"``/``None``
raised ``TypeError`` out of the comparison itself, from a ``validate`` documented
to *return* problems. ``rollout_steps=True`` was worse than a short run: FastSAC
ran 16 single-step iterations instead of 4 of 4, and PPO normalized advantages
over a length-one batch and died inside torch's ``Normal`` constraint.

``num_envs``, the third factor of ``steps_per_iter``, is outside this gate because
which *counts* are usable differs per backend - PPO parallelizes and accepts any
positive count, the MuJoCo-backed FastSAC requires exactly ``1`` - so that half is
not one shared rule. It is only that half: whether the value is a count at all is
the same domain, and each backend consults it before asking its own count rule, so
the third factor of this product is held to what its two siblings are held to.
:class:`TestNumEnvsIsNotInTheSharedDomain` pins the scope line;
``test_rl_env_count_domain.py`` pins the shared half.

Every domain test here reaches the real ``validate`` entry point, so it covers
the wiring as well as the domain.
