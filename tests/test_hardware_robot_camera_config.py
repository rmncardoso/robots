"""Behavior tests for per-camera config construction on the hardware ``Robot``.

``Robot(..., cameras={"front": {...}})`` describes each camera with a free-form
dict. Those keys are the fields of lerobot's ``OpenCVCameraConfig``, so the
accepted vocabulary must be *derived* from the dataclass rather than
hand-picked. A hand-picked list has two silent failure modes, both pinned here:

    - every field it forgets is **unreachable** -- no caller can set it at all,
      so the camera streams at the default with no signal (``warmup_s`` and
      ``backend`` were both unreachable);
    - every key it does not recognise is **discarded** -- so ``heigth=1080``
      reported success having configured 480p (AGENTS.md > Review Learnings
      (#86) > "Reject silently-dropped kwargs").

The reachability test is deliberately written against
``dataclasses.fields(OpenCVCameraConfig)`` rather than a fixed list of field
names, so a field lerobot adds in a future release fails this test until it is
verified reachable, instead of quietly joining the unreachable set.

No serial/USB hardware is touched: only config dataclasses are constructed.
