"""One Kimodo sampling seed, one domain, whichever surface sets it.

The seed is used twice, and the two uses have to agree. It is handed to the
sampler, and it is part of the key ``KimodoPolicy`` identifies the buffered
motion by - a key built by coercing the seed with ``int()``. A seed that is not
already whole therefore names a different sample than the one it produces:
``2.5`` and ``2.9`` reach the sampler as themselves and key as ``2``, so the
second reseed reads as a cache hit and replays the first episode's motion while
reporting that a new seed was applied. ``nan`` and ``inf`` do not survive the
coercion at all and raise out of the private key builder mid-rollout, and
``inf`` arrives from a JSON config file as the well-formed ``1e400``.

Four surfaces set this seed - the constructor, ``from_dict``, ``from_json``, and
a ``KimodoPolicy(seed=...)`` override - and a fifth, ``KimodoPolicy.reset``,
stores a per-episode reseed with ``object.__setattr__`` and so never re-enters
``__post_init__``. A sixth is the per-call ``get_actions(..., seed=...)``
override the method's own docstring lists: it is read straight from ``kwargs``
and reaches the sampler and the key without passing through the config at all,
and ``PolicyRunner.run`` / ``evaluate`` forward ``policy_kwargs`` verbatim to
every ``get_actions`` call, so it is a routine path rather than a private one.
All six consult ``sampling_seed_error``, so the tables below run every spelling
past every surface.

The ACCEPTED rows are controls that hold on both sides of the fix: a whole seed
of either sign or any width still works, ``2`` and ``2.0`` still deliberately
name ONE motion, and ``None`` still draws fresh entropy. Magnitude is left to
the appliers, which report it themselves.
