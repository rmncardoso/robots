"""A single camera key passed as a bare string must not be read one key per character.

``image_keys`` names an ordered list of key names on the LeRobot local provider,
which declares model VISUAL feature keys with it
(:func:`~strands_robots.policies.lerobot_local.molmoact2.derive_image_keys`). It
did not validate the shape, and reduced the value with ``list(...)``.

``str`` is iterable, so ``list("wrist")`` is ``['w', 'r', 'i', 's', 't']`` - five
names the caller never wrote. Nothing downstream can tell that apart from a
deliberate five-entry list, so it was accepted and the consequence surfaced far
from the call: with no embodiment configured (``preflight`` returned early in
that case), a model built declaring one bogus VISUAL feature per character.

Two neighbouring shapes failed the same way: a non-``str`` entry became a key,
and a repeated entry could not be honored as written - this side builds a feature
dict, where a duplicate collapses and declares fewer features than asked for.

These tests pin the shared domain
(:func:`strands_robots.utils.name_list_error`), that all three surfaces that
receive the value agree on the SHAPE, and that each refusal precedes the
expensive work it guards.

The emptiness verdict is deliberately not part of that agreement: the shared
domain returns no verdict for an empty sequence, leaving it to the receiving
surface. This parameter DECLARES the model's visual features, and absence derives
them from the embodiment, so an empty list here keeps its "not supplied" meaning.
:class:`TestTheEmptinessVerdictIsTheSurfaces` states that rather than leaving it
to be read out of a parity table.
