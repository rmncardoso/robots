"""Every public class across ``strands_robots.policies`` must document its public members.

:mod:`tests.policies.test_provider_policy_docstrings` already pins the docstring
contract for the backend *provider* Policy classes (GR00T, cuRobo, cosmos3, the
two lerobot providers, MoveIt2, the two WBC controllers) and
:mod:`tests.policies.test_builtin_policy_docstrings` pins the dependency-free
built-ins. Neither reaches the *ancillary* public classes the providers lean on:
the ZMQ ``MsgSerializer`` wire codecs and the LeRobot
:class:`ProcessorStep` subclasses that pack and
normalize observations. An agent reading the tree to drive a provider blind
still lands on those helpers, so each of their public methods and properties
needs its own docstring rather than leaning silently on an inherited one (a
``transform_features`` override that is a deliberate passthrough has to say so).

This guard walks every module across the policies tree by AST (no import, so it
needs none of the optional policy backends -- ``[groot]`` / ``[cosmos3]`` /
``[moveit2]`` / ``[wbc]`` / ``[lerobot]`` -- installed) and fails
if any public method or property of a public class defines no docstring. It
mirrors the tools-package guard (``tests/tools/test_public_member_docstrings.py``).
Property setters and deleters are exempt: a ``@x.setter`` mirrors its documented
getter and a docstring on it is noise, matching the convention elsewhere.
