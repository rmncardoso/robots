"""Relative-action RTC re-anchoring reports the conversions it cannot make.

:meth:`~strands_robots.policies.lerobot_local.policy.LerobotLocalPolicy._absolute_rtc_leftover`
converts the unexecuted tail of a chunk into absolute robot coordinates so the
NEXT chunk can be re-anchored against the moved robot state. It returns ``None``
in three cases, and only the first is benign:

* the policy is not relative-action - its frame does not move, so there is
  nothing to re-anchor and nothing to report;
* the processor bridge has no postprocessor;
* the postprocessor does not yield a plain action tensor.

The last two are degradations rather than no-ops. The policy *is*
relative-action, so every following chunk blends a stale-frame prefix - the
outcome ``_resolve_rtc_rebase_steps`` warns about when LeRobot's re-anchor
helper is unavailable, and which the sibling module's
``test_relative_action_falls_back_when_reanchor_helper_unavailable`` pins as
"warn once ... never crash or silently drop the prefix". Both of these took that
same degradation silently, behind the INFO line announcing that re-anchoring was
enabled.

These tests drive all three fallbacks: the benign one stays silent, both
degradations report once naming their cause and the stale-frame consequence, the
latch survives ``reset()`` (a pipeline shape does not change between episodes),
and the degraded prefix that actually reaches the denoiser is measured. The scope
boundary is pinned too - a postprocessor that *raises* stays fatal rather than
being downgraded to a silent ``None``.
