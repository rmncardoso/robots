"""A planar direction goal is refused by name, and the refusal states the rule.

:func:`~strands_robots.policies.motionbricks.observation._unit_direction` reads two
of the issue #300 well-known goal keys - ``target_velocity`` and
``target_heading`` - and normalises each to a unit 3-vector in the world XY
plane. Three things about that read were not graded anywhere.

The near-zero fallback is a magnitude test, so it cannot cover a non-finite
component. ``nan < 1e-6`` is ``False`` and ``inf`` divided by its own norm is
``nan``, so either one fell straight through the fallback and produced a
``movement_direction`` of ``[nan, nan, nan]`` - handed to the generator, from a
call that reported success. That is exactly the outcome the fallback exists to
prevent, and two shipped cells in ``test_policy.py`` say so in their own words
("instead of fabricating a NaN/garbage heading", "must not yield a NaN
direction") while driving only the inputs where the fallback does fire. The
property was stated and the input that violates it was never passed.

The refusal named neither key. One helper serves two documented keys, and both
answered ``direction vector must have 2 or 3 entries``, so a caller who passed
both could not tell which one was refused. The sibling locomotion family names
its key in every refusal - :meth:`WBCPolicy._validate_velocity` answers
``target_velocity must have at least 3 elements [vx, vy, omega]`` - and the ABC's
stated reason for leaving the component count out of the goal contract is that
"each receiver states its own arity and refuses a shape it cannot use", which
requires the refusal to say which receiver and which key.

And the message stated a rule the check did not enforce. Five statements in the
package give the rule as two or three components; the check tested ``< 2`` alone,
so four, six and twenty components were accepted and read for their first two
entries. The wire validator defers the count here deliberately ("the component
COUNT is not checked against any receiver's arity here"), so this is the only
place it is checked at all.

The per-component domain is now the shared
:func:`~strands_robots.utils.finite_vector_error` the sim setters already use, so
a ``bool`` is refused by name rather than read as ``1.0`` and the wording matches
the rest of the library. The cells below drive both keys and both doors: the
per-call kwarg and the constructor default.
